    <span>Welcome to the help page for <span class="blue">Join</span>, your guide to using our kanban project management
      tool. Here, we'll provide an overview of what <span class="blue">Join</span> is, how it can benefit you, and how
      to use it.</span>
    <h3>What is Join?</h3>
    <span><span class="blue">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of
      dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.<br><br> Kanban, a Japanese
      term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize
      efficiency (or flow). <span class="blue">Join</span> leverages the principles of kanban to help users manage their
      tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.<br><br> It is important to note that <span
        class="blue">Join</span> is designed as an educational exercise and is not intended for extensive business
      usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent availability,
      reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding <span class="blue">Join</span>.</span>

      <div>
        <h4>Exploring the Board</h4>
        <span>When you log in to <span class="blue">Join</span>, you'll find a default board. This board represents your
          project and contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".</span>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h4>Creating Contacts</h4>
        <span>In <span class="blue">Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the
          "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts
          can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="orderedList">
      <p>3.</p>
      <div>
        <h4>Adding Cards</h4>
        <span>Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual tasks. Click
          the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in the card, like
          task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="orderedList">
      <p>4.</p>
      <div>
        <h4>Moving Cards</h4>
        <span>As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging and dropping
          the card from one list to another.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="orderedList">
      <p>5.</p>
      <div>
        <h4>Deleting Cards</h4>
        <span>Deleting Cards Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting
          a card will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action
          is irreversible.<br><br> Remember that using <span class="blue">Join</span> effectively requires consistent
          updates from you and your team to ensure the board reflects the current state of your project.<br><br> Have
